 * SET Game Detector Core Logic
 *

 * It offers two deployment methods:
 * 1. Frontend-only (with mock data for demonstration)
 * 2. Full-stack solution with Python backend (recommended for production)

/**
 * DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
 * 
 * OPTION 1: FRONTEND-ONLY DEPLOYMENT (DEMO MODE)
 * =============================================
 * The current implementation above uses mock data and can be deployed without 
 * a Python backend. This is useful for demonstration purposes, but won't 
 * actually detect real SETs.
 * 
 * To deploy frontend-only:
 * 1. Build the React app: `npm run build`
 * 2. Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static hosting service
 *    (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
 * 
 * 
 * OPTION 2: FULL-STACK SOLUTION (RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION)
 * =========================================================
 * For a complete working solution, you'll need to deploy both:
 * 
 * A. The React frontend (this app)
 * B. A Python backend service that performs the actual SET detection
 * 
 * There are several ways to deploy the full-stack solution:
 * 
 * 1. SEPARATE DEPLOYMENT (EASIEST)
 *    - Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
 *    - Deploy the Python backend to a service that supports Python (Heroku, PythonAnywhere, etc.)
 *    - Update this file to call your backend API
 * 
 * 2. SINGLE-SERVER APPROACH
 *    - Deploy both frontend and backend on a single server (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
 *    - Use a web server (Nginx, Apache) to serve the static frontend files
 *    - Run the Python backend as a service on the same server
 * 
 * 3. CONTAINERIZED DEPLOYMENT (ADVANCED)
 *    - Package the frontend and backend together in Docker containers
 *    - Deploy using Docker Compose or Kubernetes
 *    - This approach offers the best isolation and scalability
 * 
 * Example full-stack implementation:

      method: 'POST',

    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('API request failed');
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error calling SET detection API:", error);
    return {
      success: false,
      error: "Failed to process image"
    };
  }
};

/**
 * MODEL DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
 * 
 * The Python backend requires ML models to function. You can:
 * 
 * 1. Include models directly in your backend repository (good for small models)
 * 2. Load models from a separate storage service like AWS S3 (good for large models)
 * 3. Use a hosted ML service (like Hugging Face)
 * 
 * Model file structure in your Python backend:
 * /models
 *   /Characteristics
 *     /11022025
 *       shape_model.keras
 *       fill_model.keras
 *   /Shape
 *     /15052024
 *       best.pt
 *   /Card
 *     /16042024
 *       best.pt
